# You Do

Create an `ArrayList` of `10` random `Integer` values between `-10` and `10`, inclusive.

Implement a selection sort that sorts the values from greatest to least (notice that this is backwards from how it typically works, which means we will have to find maximums rather than minimums!).

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
