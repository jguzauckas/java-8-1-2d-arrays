# Basics Check

In `Check.java`, there is some code that fills a `Double` `ArrayList` with random values between `0.0` and `100.0` (including `0.0`, not including `100.0`). 

Use insertion sort to sort the `ArrayList`. Print the list before and after to make sure it works properly.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
