# Understanding Check

You are provided the `String` `ArrayList` `vocab`, which contains over 4,000 of the most common English words ranked by frequency (how often they show up in various places like books).

Create and write the method `vocabInsertionSort` that sorts the words based on their lengths from least to greatest. It does not `return` anything (as it edits the original `ArrayList`), and takes a `String` `ArrayList` as its parameter. You can choose to implement either sorting algorithm for this.

Create and write the method `printLongestWords` that prints out all of the longest words in the provided `ArrayList`. This method is going to be called after the list is sorted, which means you can expect the list to already be sorted from least length to greatest length when writing it. It should identify the longest length word present, and then print out all words that match that length in the list (in no particular order). This method should return the number of words found at the longest length as an `int` value. It takes a `String` `ArrayList` as its parameter.

Trial code is already written in the `main` method, so your results should be printed when run once you complete the methods. The trial code will print out a small sample of the list to help you determine if it is being sorted properly!

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
